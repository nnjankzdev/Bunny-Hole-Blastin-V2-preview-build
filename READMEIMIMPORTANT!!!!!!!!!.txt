oh yea no CC rn we're going to release a update to the PB in like 2 days or some shit idk

winRAR is needed to actually use the fucking preview build bc the FNF devs are retarded and it cant open without it bc of the lime.ndll so ye just download that bc we all know ur going to delete this once the full game comes out on EVoL .ecneirepxe .2202 41 yraubef.

ORDER:

Pico
Philly Nice
MILF
Monster
